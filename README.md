## Problem Statement
While the world of online communication is vast, there are limited products where students can virtually come together to study in a fun classroom setting. When big study groups or students who have online classes need to meet, products like Zoom can’t provide the immersion that Class-ify does. Class-ify is the only all-in-one virtual classroom experience that provides students with all of the tools they would need to not only succeed, but excel in their classes.

## Project Objectives
- Create a server that acts as a meeting room where others can join using a join code.
- Build a 2D game map to represent the classroom.
- Implement features to enhance student interactions such as voice chat.
- Create in-game textures that act as resource sharing areas for students to upload and download files.
- Develop incentives for the students to join the classroom such as a shop with items.

## Stakeholders
Users: Students who want to connect with peers to study and share materials

## Deliverables
- A 2D Desktop game built with Unity and C# that allows users to walk around and interact with one another and the environment.
- Firebase database to maintain data for users, the virtual classrooms, and associated resources.
- Voice chat system utilizing Vivox that connects users’ microphones and speakers to one another when they join.
- System to allow users to import/export files when interacting with certain aspects in the game map.
- An in-game whiteboard that can be drawn on by users and is concurrently updated in real time.
- Online Photon servers to create rooms that users can connect to using a join code, updating their in-game view.
- In-game shop with various cosmetics that allow the user to customize their character/the environment.
